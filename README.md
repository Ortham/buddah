# buddah
A simple registry for community-made game modding software.

Please fork and add any missing projects you know of, and spread the word! Any utility can be added, on GitHub or not, open source or not, and in any state of completion. The more we know about what's already done, the less work we may end up repeating.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to add new entries to the list.
